computer keeps turning off (eg when player progresses to certain point in email)
	-> subsequent times introduce additional environmental effects:
		-> light flickering
		-> power going out (light, clock radio)
		-> radio starts playing creepy music / whispers
teeth falling out
	-> get in way of typing -> have to be moved/removed
	-> huge outpouring of teeth later / periodically in increasing volume
keyboard keys popping off
	-> have to be replaced
		-> click on / pick up from desk
		-> maybe fall off desk later
			-> have to click small area under where keycap was
			-> lil player / mouse brings back later?
			-> ALL the keys pop off in an eruption
ghost/prompt email text starts sliding down the screen
	-> early occurrences: reset to position after time elapsed or computer power cycle
	-> later: stay on desk/keyboard, persisting through power cycle
	-> laterer: ghost text character and filled text character shift out of alignment
player shrinking to controllable character
	-> transition out of this mode by re-arriving and typing squishes small version of player
		-> bunch of lil players spawn later and smush -> blood all over keys

	- keys
		- slide around (letters too, disconnect from keys)
		- slide under each other (and maybe pressing one passes through to the other)
		- change size
		- colors changing
	- statically / oneshot
	- continually shifting
	- toggling to light/dark mode
		- along with a color set that as a result makes text illegible/invisible
	- teeth
	- sounds:
		- key press sound changes:
			- modulating continuously
			- base sound changes
				- abruptly
				- only sometimes
					- phone screen smunching sound
					- squish
					- yelp
			- base sound slowly morphs into more unsettling sound/version
	- "hurt" sound/visual
		- at first, when wrong key hit
		- later: randomly? always (during a particular fever event)?
	- screen turns off
		- old school / tube tv style
		- either way: resets typing progress
	- blink
		- could be used to reset some effects
		- when fever event: resets typing progress
		- when fever event: typed words change to gibberish, or an inappropriate gushy or hateful message
	- autocorrect
	- ghost text
		- move/slide/rotate
		- other effects like wiggle / double vision
	- failure to send
		- shake message bubble
	- bubbles
		- fall off screen
		- rotate, slide, change color
	- screen cracks

	- audio
		- voice
			- player character reactions a la:
				- that cant be real
				- oh fuck
				- nooooooo
				- what?
		- key press sounds (see abopve)
		- low-key theme, swells? into unsettling land; abrupt shifts
			- if unsettling music matches tempo / aligns with main theme, can sync / play both at start and adjust volume
			- abrupt shift CAN be an abrupt volume shift a la the gradual introduction described, BUT
				- might be accompanied by a sound effects
					- just make sure you're either:
						- fine with them occuring over any part of the song, OR
						- have a part of the song in mind (or multiple candidate timestamps)
							that you want to instantaneously jump to
				- might jump us to the beginning (or a specific spot in) a different track (or the playing track)

		- any of the music that can line up, great for swapping between or shifting slowly

		- BIG WISH / POST JAM: you might have multiple "bundles" of music tracks, that we switch between
			- each bundle (from the listener's perspective) is a "track" that changes dynamically
	
	FOR THE JAM:
		- low key theme to start
		- one (or more) more unsettling version that shares its tempo, tracking etc.

		BONUS:	- VERY unsettling version OR other track entirely.

Shipping your game with dynamic linking enabled is not recommended
because it requires you to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game,
it prevents certain optimizations, and can increase the size of your game.
If you remove the dynamic_linking feature, your game executable can run standalone.

---------

All app logic in Bevy uses the Entity Component System paradigm (ECS).
https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/ecs/

Entities - unique "things" that are assigned groups of
Components - which are then processed using
Systems

Components: Rust structs that implement the Component trait
#[derive(Component)]
struct Position {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

Systems: normal Rust functions
fn print_position_system(query: Query<&Position>) {
    for position in &query {
        println!("position: {} {}", position.x, position.y);
    }
}

Entities: a simple type containing a unique integer
struct Entity(u64);
