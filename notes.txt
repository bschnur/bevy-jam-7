computer keeps turning off (eg when player progresses to certain point in email)
	-> subsequent times introduce additional environmental effects:
		-> light flickering
		-> power going out (light, clock radio)
		-> radio starts playing creepy music / whispers
teeth falling out
	-> get in way of typing -> have to be moved/removed
	-> huge outpouring of teeth later / periodically in increasing volume
keyboard keys popping off
	-> have to be replaced
		-> click on / pick up from desk
		-> maybe fall off desk later
			-> have to click small area under where keycap was
			-> lil player / mouse brings back later?
			-> ALL the keys pop off in an eruption
ghost/prompt email text starts sliding down the screen
	-> early occurrences: reset to position after time elapsed or computer power cycle
	-> later: stay on desk/keyboard, persisting through power cycle
	-> laterer: ghost text character and filled text character shift out of alignment
player shrinking to controllable character
	-> transition out of this mode by re-arriving and typing squishes small version of player
		-> bunch of lil players spawn later and smush -> blood all over keys

Shipping your game with dynamic linking enabled is not recommended
because it requires you to include libbevy_dylib alongside your game,
it prevents certain optimizations, and can increase the size of your game.
If you remove the dynamic_linking feature, your game executable can run standalone.

---------

All app logic in Bevy uses the Entity Component System paradigm (ECS).
https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/ecs/

Entities - unique "things" that are assigned groups of
Components - which are then processed using
Systems

Components: Rust structs that implement the Component trait
#[derive(Component)]
struct Position {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

Systems: normal Rust functions
fn print_position_system(query: Query<&Position>) {
    for position in &query {
        println!("position: {} {}", position.x, position.y);
    }
}

Entities: a simple type containing a unique integer
struct Entity(u64);
